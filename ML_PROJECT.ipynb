Maintaining a consistent interpass temperature is critical for ensuring the quality and mechanical properties of the weld. In some rows, the recorded value for this variable is given as a range, such as 150-200°C, rather than a single temperature. Since we need a numerical value for further analysis, we will transform this interval into its median value, which in this case is 175°C. This allows us to approximate the interpass temperature while ensuring that the data remains consistent and usable for modeling purposes."
